# i. About the Author
Pekin<sup>SOFT</sup> Systems:tm: is a computer consulting company located in Pekin, IL, and owned by the author, Sean Carrick. Sean has been around computers and programming since 1983, and has been professionally involved with computers, in one way or another, since 1996. Most of his professional experience in the Information Technology (IT) field has revolved around computer programming, from his time as a network/systems administrator, through his time working as a 32-bit Microsoft Visual Basic programmer, right up to today writing J2SE/Swing applications in Java.

Sean's experience also branches into other fields, including law enforcement, the legal field, and the trucking industry. With the life experiences he has gained, he has great insight into developing software from the ground up. One of his biggest desires has always been to help others bring their experiences into computer programming and helping them to achieve success with making that move.

As a huge proponent, and active community member, of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), Sean believes that knowledge, *all* knowledge, should be freely shared. Because of this deeply-held belief, he has decided to embark upon this journey of creating a book for an introduction to computer programming. With this in mind, we would like to point out that this book is not ***just*** an introduction to the Java language and the Apache NetBeans IDE. It is also an introduction to programming concepts and disciplines that carry to all programming languages.

One last thing that we should mention is that this book was born out of a theory of Sean's. As he was driving around listening to SiriusXM radio, he kept hearing commercials for the Babble language learning app and software. They touted how they used the "*full-immersion*" language learning technique to teach their subscribers the foreign language of their choice. This piqued Sean's interest, so he did some research into the *full-immersion* technique for learning languages. Through his research, he learned that the best way to learn a foreign language is to move to a country that speaks the desired language natively. In other words, if one wanted to learn Italian, the best way to do so would be to move to Italy. By being fully immersed in the language (as well as the culture), the mind just naturally learns better. We need only to look at toddlers to understand that this is true. Toddlers learn to speak their the native language of their parents by simply hearing it constantly, and inducing what the words mean by way of the context in which they are used.

So, Sean formed a theory...if full-immersion works so well for *natural* languages, could that technique be applied to an *artifical* language? He reasoned that natural or artificial, a language is a language. All languages have a specific syntax. All languages have rules for how different types of words are used. All languages have (and are) semantics. Therefore, if full-immersion works for natural languages, it should also work for artificial languages, such as C/C++, Python, and Java. Was Sean's theory proven correct? We don't yet know...You will be able to let us know, however, because this book was born out of Sean's desire to put his theory to the test.

It is our belief that if you embark upon this journey, you will gain a great understanding of what it takes to become a high-quality, professional programmer. Furthermore, we believe that you will come away from this book with such a solid understanding of the Java language and the best use of the Apache NetBeans IDE, that you will continue down this path for life. We also believe that if you so desire, you will be able to use the knowledge and skills that you learn on the following pages to become a professional Java programmer, well on your way to becoming a full-fledged software engineer.

We truly do hope that you will enjoy this book and find all of the joys that are Java programming!
