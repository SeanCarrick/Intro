# ii. Preface
Typically, a book such as this one would begin by explaining the prerequisites to use the material taught in it. However, as you most likely found this book because you are interested in learning how to program in Java, I am going to assume that you already have what you need and just want to get to learning the Java programming language. Be that as it may, I am going to list the prerequisites very quickly, just to "comply with the norm":wink:.

* Access to a computer on which you have the ability to install software.
* The Java Development Kit (JDK) [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/) or [Oracle JDK](https://oracle.com/java/).
* The [Apache NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
* The willingness to try new things.
* A desire to learn how to program, generally, and in Java, specifically.

If you meet these prerequisites, you are ready to embark upon this journey.

## Book Setup
This book is made up of many, many chapters, due to the complexity of the subject being discussed. Therefore, I am putting a roadmap, of sorts, here for your review.

Each chapter will be broken into various sections, but every chapter should have the same sections to them, at least after we start developing our application project.

The first two chapters, "The Java Programming Language" and "Apache NetBeans IDE", are structurally broken into these sections:

1. The Java Programming Language
   
   A brief overview of Java as a whole.
   1. Fundamentals
   2. Tools
   3. Features
   4. Creating a Terminal Project
   5. Creating a Desktop Project
   6. Conclusion
2. Apache NetBeans IDE
   
   A brief overview of Apache NetBeans as a whole.
   1. Fundamentals
   2. Tools
   3. Features
   4. Creating a Terminal Project
   5. Creating a Desktop Project
   6. Conclusion

The chapter about *The Programmer's Algorithm* has the following structure, which by chance, follows The Programmer's Algorithm:

1. The Idea
2. Planning the Project
3. Designing the Project
4. Developing the Project
5. Testing the Project
6. Releasing the Project
7. Maintaining the Project
8. Conclusion: Wash, Rinse, Repeat

The rest of the chapters, in which we will be planning, developing, and testing a fully-functional Java/Swing desktop application, will follow the structure of "The Programmer's Algorithm" chapter, somewhat anyway. Not all of those chapters have a "Releasing the Project", nor a "Maintaining the Project" section, as those two functions only take place when the application development has been "completed". You will learn all about this in Chapter 3.

## Before We Begin...
To help you understand the different icons and fonts that you will see in this book, I just want to briefly explain them here. Throughout the regular text, I will be placing emojis that describe my attitude and/or voice inflection at the moment that I typed the text. My goal is to make this book more like a conversation between friends than like a lecture in a college or university. I believe that the more relaxed tone will aide you in actually learning and staying engaged with the text. Most importantly, I am hoping this will be ***fun*** :grin:!

So, the emojis that I will be using will have these rough meanings associated with them:

* :wink: means that I'm being serious, but with a bit of sarcasm thrown in for good measure.
* :laughing: is pretty obvious...I think that I just made a great joke :laughing:.
* :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: means that I believe that what I just said is super obvious.
* :smirk: means that I was being totally sarcastic in what I just said.
* :confused: means that we need to put a bit more thought into the concept just mentioned.
* :zzz: means that I'm getting bored, so you must be going bonkers, therefore it's time to move on.

I will also be calling out individual paragraphs in the text with some symbols. The definition of these symbols are:

* :x: Never do this! I may be showing you something stupid that I have done in my life and am warning you that it is ***never*** a good idea.
* :heavy_exclamation_mark: This is a warning. It means that while the concept or code will work, it may have unforeseen consequences.
* :bangbang: This means danger. Whatever I am talking about in a paragraph marked with this icon is something that you really need to read. It may just prevent the wall meeting your face in the future :wink:.
* :dart: Paragraphs marked with this icon are explaining a best practice.
* :pencil2: Paragraphs marked with this icon are just a note about what we were just discussing.
* :notebook: Notebook paragraphs are providing additional information about the current topic. You don't necessarily need to read these paragraphs right then, but you should come back and read them if you still have questions.
* :wrench: Wrench paragraphs are explaining configurations and settings that you may want to make.
* :bulb: Lightbulb paragraphs are just quick tips.
* :mag: These paragraphs are pointing you to further research and will typically contain links to a website or two.
* :ant: These paragraphs are explaining a bug that I have introduced into the source code. Yeah, I know, "What a ***JERK***!" But, by me doing this, you *will* get to learn how to debug your source code, so there *is* that. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
* :zap: If I have introduced a bug earlier on, you will see paragraphs marked with this icon. The fix for that bug is here.

## One Last Thing...
Before we get out of this :zzz:*boring*:zzz: section, I would just like to ask that you provide me with feedback on this book. If you notice typos or really bad/awkward wording somewhere, file an issue on the book's GitHub project for me. I would love to fix those types of issues as quickly as I can. Also, if you have an idea of how I can improve or enhance this book, also you may file an issue to let me know. I really appreciate any and all feedback that I am able to get! It's what helps me improve.

I truly hope that you enjoy this book and that you learn Java and the Apache NetBeans IDE thoroughly by time you finish.
